this mod add a little robobro to half life 2

robobro should spawn with you and be your best friend from there on in
if he dosen't type create_Robro into the console to spawn him.

i've only included the files i worked on here and they're compiled client and server dlls

just dump the two dlls into the bin folder of a steam 2007 mod project and run it.

i'd like to point out that while i didn't hit feature completetion
i set up the ground work for all the features we discussed
and built a source entity from scratch that could be integrated into any source mod almost seamlessly. 
which is not easy if you want anything resembeling complex behavior
